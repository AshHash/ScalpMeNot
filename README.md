## Smart Contract based on Blind Auction example


Currently in retail, multiple hot commodity items reach the U.S. marketplace each year 
with limited quantity releases. Items such as Sony's Playstation 5 or Adidas' Yeezy shoe 
line release at set price points despite there being people who are willing to pay more. 
This hurts both those consumers that are unable to purchase the item and the company's 
bottom line. Our suggestion to this particular problem is to set aside a certain amount 
of items and auction them to the the highest bidders. This will allow customers to in a 
sense skip the line if they are willing to pay more and companies to maximize their profits. 
This contract will handle the auction of the item and transactions associated with the auction.
We will be modifying the smart contract provided in the [example](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.13/solidity-by-example.html#id2) provided in Solidity's documentation, to account for multiple winners of a blind auction.
